- embed code-128 data in barcode.rkt
- generate barcode from "location" "eventid" "userid"
- location is a string and the last 2 are ints
  - location 'code-c eventid 'fnc1 userid
    with the fnc1 code used to make a difference between the fields
- write out to PPM
- use imagemagick to convert out to png
- write the png to s3

* AWS LAMBDA
- use [[https://www.lambrospetrou.com/articles/aws-lambda-meets-racket][this]] to get racket code to within the lambda
  as racketscript is non-functional due to some import error.

- the main problem will be with using imagemagick-native/similar with npm
  either
  - docker
  - or somehow getting it to install on my machine.
    then copying that into the lambda function zip
    that or using the docker for a dev env and then uploading that zip
** w/docker
get imagemagick-native npm package to work on docker
get racket-minimal on that image
get the code to output a ppm
use imagemagick to output to s3 bucket as a png
upload to aws
